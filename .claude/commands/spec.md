Help me write or update a specification document for OrbitCove.

Context:
- This is a planning-phase project for a community platform iOS app
- All specs go in the /docs/ directory
- Follow the format and detail level of existing docs (01-PRD.md, 02-Technical-Architecture.md, etc.)
- Use markdown with clear headings, tables, and ASCII diagrams where helpful
- Include revision history at the end

If updating an existing doc, read it first and preserve the structure.
