# Specification Writer Skill

## Overview

This skill helps create comprehensive planning and specification documents for the OrbitCove project.

## Document Types

1. **PRD (Product Requirements Document)**: Features, user stories, success metrics
2. **Technical Architecture**: System design, tech stack, security, scalability
3. **Data Model**: Entity relationships, schema, migrations
4. **UX Flows**: User journeys, wireframes, interaction patterns
5. **Information Architecture**: Navigation, content hierarchy, deep linking

## Writing Guidelines

- Start with an executive summary
- Use tables for structured comparisons
- Include ASCII diagrams for visual concepts
- Be specific and actionable, not generic
- Challenge assumptions when you see issues
- End with revision history

## Document Structure

Each document should include:
- Table of contents
- Version and status header
- Clear section headings
- Diagrams where helpful
- Open questions or decisions needed
- Revision history

## References

Before writing, read existing docs in `/docs/` to match style and maintain consistency.
